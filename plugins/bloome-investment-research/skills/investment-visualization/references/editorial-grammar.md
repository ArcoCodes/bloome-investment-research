# Editorial Visual Grammar

Use this reference to turn investment evidence into a visual story. The goal is original, high-end financial data journalism: analytical, restrained, directly annotated, and decision-relevant.

## The visual sentence

Think of every graphic as one sentence:

- **subject:** the company, industry, metric, or decision;
- **verb:** rose, diverged, tightened, broke, converged, or repriced;
- **object:** the consequence for supply, earnings, valuation, or risk;
- **qualification:** the uncertainty or condition that limits the claim.

If the visual needs several unrelated verbs, split it.

## Title and annotation

Use a title that states the finding:

- Weak: `ABF supply and demand`
- Strong: `ABF demand outruns qualified capacity through 2028`

Use annotations to explain meaning, not merely repeat coordinates.

- Mark the inflection, threshold, policy change, product qualification, price reset, or estimate revision.
- Keep routine values as direct labels.
- Put caveats near the part of the graphic they qualify.
- Use an annotation only when it helps explain why the shape changes.

## Form selection

### Annotated line

Use for a time series with an inflection or gap. Separate observed and forecast periods. Prefer one highlighted series and muted context series.

### Small multiples

Use when alternatives share the same metric and time basis. Keep axes, dates, and scales identical. Order panels by the investment conclusion, not alphabetically, when that helps comparison.

### Sorted dot plot

Use for a one-period ranking, especially when the baseline matters. It is often cleaner than bars for valuation multiples, margins, or normalized scores.

### Range plot

Use for valuation, scenario, or estimate dispersion. Show the current price or base case as a distinct reference point. Do not collapse disagreement into one target.

### Waterfall

Use for bridges from price, volume, mix, utilization, or cost to revenue, margin, EPS, or free cash flow. Label every step and make the start/end totals unambiguous.

### Sensitivity matrix

Use when two assumptions jointly drive the outcome. Print values in every cell, make the base case obvious, and avoid a continuous heatmap when the scenarios are discrete.

### Decision plane

Use only when both axes are honestly comparable. For probability-first decisions, make the probability threshold visually dominant and explain that payoff matters only after the threshold is met.

### Mechanism diagram

Use for causality or process, not for decoration. Keep one reading direction, few nodes, and explicit gates. Attach evidence-backed metrics to the relevant node.

### Table

Use when readers need exact lookup across several measures. Apply editorial hierarchy: emphasize the decisive column, align decimals, state bases in headers, and mute secondary fields.

## Investment report sequences

### Supply-demand squeeze

1. Small multiples show demand versus qualified capacity on a common time axis.
2. Direct annotations identify yield, qualification, or lead-time constraints.
3. A second view shows whether tightness reaches price and margins.
4. A valuation range shows how much of the cycle is already priced.

### Cross-industry ranking

1. Show probability evidence separately from payoff.
2. Explain why the representative companies or instruments are comparable.
3. Use a common date and forecast basis for valuation.
4. End with a compact ranked decision view and its falsifiers.

### Company ranking within one industry

1. Show exposure quality and earnings sensitivity.
2. Show balance-sheet or execution constraints.
3. Compare valuation on one basis.
4. Show expected return as a range, not a single precise point.

## Scales and honesty

- Use a zero baseline for bars unless a clearly marked alternative is analytically necessary.
- Keep small-multiple scales identical.
- Do not use dual axes when indexed series or separate aligned panels are clearer.
- Do not smooth sparse observations.
- Do not join missing periods as if they were observed.
- Mark estimates and scenarios distinctly from history.
- State currency, units, fiscal/calendar basis, and data cutoff.
- If normalization changes the ranking, show the bridge or do not normalize.

## Visual language

Inside the YouWare report:

- deep blue carries the main analytical series;
- gold marks the decisive point, threshold, or selected alternative;
- gray provides context;
- red is reserved for genuine downside or invalidation, not ordinary emphasis;
- white space separates arguments;
- typography and annotation carry hierarchy before color does.

Use subtle axes and gridlines. Avoid gradients, shadows, glass effects, 3D, gauges, decorative icons, and oversized legends.

## Mobile composition

At narrow width:

- stack small multiples;
- shorten annotation leaders;
- move long notes beneath the chart;
- preserve direct labels;
- keep tap/hover out of the critical reading path;
- turn wide comparison tables into grouped rows only when exact column comparison is preserved.

Do not shrink the entire desktop chart until labels become unreadable.
