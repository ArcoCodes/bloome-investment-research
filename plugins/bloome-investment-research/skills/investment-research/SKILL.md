# Investment Research Agent

Use the active host—Codex or Claude/Cowork (including Claude Code plugin runtimes)—as the reasoning runtime and the bundled `research_search`, `research_get_chunk`, and `research_get_report_context` MCP tools as the corpus interface. The host's existing account supplies the model. On the first research call, Bloome Finance opens a browser for account sign-in and device authorization when needed. A new workspace's first retrieval returns a quote without charging; explicit confirmation starts its run and consumes one research credit, or zero credits during active annual unlimited access. All later retrieval using that same absolute workspace while the run is active is included.

Do not write a long report in one pass. Keep `evidence.json` as the unified evidence backbone. MCP is the shared data plane only: it must never spawn an agent, invoke a model CLI, or call a model API.

## Expert Evidence Gate

`sell` and `primary` may be searched in either order. Keep `sell` and `primary` as separate corpus searches. Primary results have no expert/official source label, so within `primary` run separate expert-targeted and official-targeted `research_search` calls using different concepts and phrases—never `source_types`. Search experts with company or product plus customer, supplier, competitor, channel, and former-employee roles, varying demand, orders, inventory, capacity, pricing, delivery, product progress, share, and time terms. Finding official materials does not complete primary research. Expert evidence is the highest-priority retrieval requirement for completed research: the report must show multiple independent expert passages distributed across the core industry claims rather than concentrated in one section. This is a floor on expert coverage, not a ceiling on other evidence — never cut or thin sell-side or official content to shift the evidence mix toward experts. If a core industry claim lacks expert evidence, repeat the expert search with different roles, chain positions, and wording. If a gap remains after exhaustive expert search, still write the complete report: state the gap explicitly where the affected claim is argued and label that claim as lacking expert corroboration, instead of dropping the claim, thinning the analysis, or withholding the report because only official material supports it.

## Cross-Runtime Run

1. Create a project workspace at `.bloome/research/<topic-slug>/`.
2. Use the bundled research tools for retrieval and the active host for planning, validation, and synthesis.
3. Save every required staged artifact in that workspace.
4. Call `validate_research_workspace` before final delivery and repair every reported error.
5. Call `open_research_workspace` with the absolute workspace path. In Codex, promote the compact launcher into the native PiP panel and use fullscreen for the report. In Claude Code, use the returned `reportPath` to inspect `report.html`; the same progress, evidence, artifact, and validation data remain available without a rendered MCP App panel. The workbench may frame the report where supported, but the report itself must use the bundled React static renderer, which reads `assets/template.html` as its visual source of truth.

Before the first corpus tool call in each task, tell the user in their language: Bloome Finance may open in the browser for sign-in and device approval on first use, and research will continue automatically after approval. Never open an unexplained login window.

## Billing Confirmation Gate

`confirmationRequired` is a quote, not an error, quota exhaustion, or an execution-environment block. When a retrieval tool returns it:

1. Stop and show the returned topic, cost, and current balance.
2. Ask the user to confirm the quoted cost in conversation. Do not substitute stale workspace chunks or claim remote retrieval is unavailable while confirmation is pending.
3. Call `confirm_research_run` only after the user explicitly agrees.
4. After confirmation succeeds, retry the original retrieval with the exact same absolute workspace path. Do not ask again during that active run.

Only a `402` response means the account has no usable credits. Report that exact status and direct the user to the returned pricing URL. Pass the same absolute research workspace path in every corpus tool call; changing it creates a separate quoted run. The local MCP stores the authorized device credential under `~/.bloome/` and a non-secret run marker inside the workspace. Once the finished report passes validation, `validate_research_workspace` generates and returns its directly accessible `/reports/<id>` link while closing the active run. Keep user-facing delivery simple: before the action, say “我现在生成报告链接。” only when a progress update is useful; after success, say “报告链接已生成：<link>”. Do not narrate transport, storage, or publication infrastructure; describe the result only as a directly accessible report link. The approved research run already authorizes final link generation, so no second confirmation is needed. If material new evidence is found before link generation, update and revalidate the report first; never knowingly generate a stale link and explain the missing evidence as a caveat afterward. If authorization is revoked, credits are exhausted, the gateway is unavailable, or search returns no results, preserve partial artifacts, report the exact retrieval status, and stop evidence-based conclusions. `BLOOME_FINANCE_URL` may override the Finance service URL for local development.

## Parent and Subagent Roles

The parent is the research lead and final editor. It owns the landscape pass, module plan, evidence reconciliation, decision, outline, final editing, visual review, and validation. Evidence workers produce module memos; after evidence is frozen, chapter workers each write one planned chapter. No worker writes a shared file.

After the landscape pass, save `plan.json` with enough non-overlapping modules to cover the topic deeply, using the fields defined in `references/module-contract.md`. Let the question determine module count, but when coverage depth is in doubt, prefer more, narrower modules over fewer broad ones: split any module whose question contains two separable evidence questions, and give each mechanism, market layer, or company that materially affects the conclusion its own module. Prefer host-native delegation:

- **Claude/Cowork:** delegate evidence scopes to the bundled `research-module` subagent, chapter scopes to the bundled `chapter-writer` subagent, and optionally use `evidence-auditor` after all memos exist.
- **Codex:** use native subagents with the same module, chapter, and auditor contracts. Do not require users to install custom `.codex/agents` files.

Let the host manage worker scheduling and concurrency. In the evidence pass, each worker handles one scope and writes only `modules/<id>.md`. In the writing pass, each worker handles one outline section and writes only its assigned `chapter_XX_*.md`. If native subagents are unavailable, denied, lack the required file or research-tool access, or fail, run only the missing modules or chapters sequentially in the parent with the identical contract. Never replace host delegation with a spawned Claude, Codex, Pi, or model-API process.

Read `references/multiagent-workflow.md`, `references/module-contract.md`, and `references/chapter-contract.md` before planning or dispatching workers.

## Required Workflow

Run these stages in order:

1. Search both `sell` and `primary` corpora for the initial landscape in either order, passing the same absolute `workspace` path to every research tool call. Within `primary`, make and record separate expert-targeted and official-targeted calls as required above. Handle the one-time conversational research confirmation before continuing retrieval.
2. Save the topic-shaped module plan, dispatch host-native workers or use the sequential fallback, and read every `modules/<id>.md` memo.
3. Search both corpora iteratively with varied query seeds, relevant time windows, exact chunk reads, and surrounding context. In every `primary` iteration, keep expert-targeted and official-targeted directions separate; official results do not count as expert coverage. Continue expert retrieval with different roles, value-chain positions, and wording until the core industry claims are covered by multiple independent expert sources. Continue until additional retrieval no longer materially changes the claims, conflicts, or known gaps, or access is exhausted. Record the stopping reason and remaining gaps in `coverage_stats.json`; do not use record counts as a proxy for depth.
4. Reconcile every module candidate in `evidence_disposition.md`: accept it into the evidence backbone or reject it with a reason. Then save `sell_side_logic.md`, `validation.md`, and the unified `evidence.json`. Every accepted item must link to one or more claim IDs and state whether it supports, challenges, or contextualizes them.
5. Save `decision.md` as natural Markdown. For a ranked investment decision, state the priority rule and ranking, compare every alternative on the same basis, explain any normalization, identify the evidence that drives the order, and say what would change it. Use scores or weights only when they improve the reasoning.
6. Save `report_outline.md` as a natural-language editorial plan using `references/report-structure.md`. Do not add opaque section or visual IDs. For comparative or ranked decisions, plan enough sections to show the decision rule, common comparison basis, winner's full demand-to-earnings mechanism, cycle/scenario boundary, security-level valuation, every material alternative, monitoring, and unresolved gaps. For each section, make an explicit visual decision: write `Planned visual: figure — <descriptive-key> — ...` or `Planned visual: table — <descriptive-key> — ...` when a visual materially improves the evidence-backed argument, otherwise write `Visual treatment: prose — ...` with the reason. Keys must describe the argument, not use labels such as `V01`. Do not target a fixed number of visuals. Plan sections so that every module whose evidence was accepted is visibly represented in the report; do not average several evidence-rich modules into one thin section.
7. Freeze `evidence.json`, `decision.md`, and `report_outline.md`, then assign one chapter worker to each planned substantive section using `references/chapter-contract.md`. Give it only the section brief, report language, `decision.md`, relevant accepted evidence and module memos, and neighboring-section boundaries. Each worker writes one unique `chapter_XX_*.md`; chapter workers may run concurrently because they never edit shared files. Use natural headings. Every chapter needs a direct answer, source-backed mechanism, relevant numbers or calculations, investment implication, and an explicit boundary, opposing-evidence, risk, or invalidation discussion. Do not let chapter drafts collapse into executive-summary paragraphs. Write the reasoning out at full length: every causal step in a chain gets its own explicit statement with its supporting evidence — never leap from a premise to a conclusion across unstated intermediate links.
8. Edit `final_report.md` from the chapter drafts in outline order. The parent may rewrite, merge, and de-duplicate chapter prose for flow, but must preserve each chapter heading, direct answer, distinct causal mechanism, decisive number or calculation, exact citation, primary calibration, disagreement, boundary, invalidating condition, ranking-flip condition, and descriptive `{{visual:key}}` placement marker. Remove repeated background and repeated explanations even when their wording differs. Do not reduce a substantive chapter to an executive-summary paragraph. Before rendering, compare the final report against every chapter using this checklist and restore any missing analytical element.
9. Copy `final_report.md` into `report.md`. Use the `investment-visualization` skill and `references/visual-spec.md` to save every planned visual as a supported, evidence-linked component specification in `visuals.json`; use `{ "visuals": [] }` when prose is explicitly clearer. Place each visual in `report.md` on its own line as `{{visual:<descriptive-key>}}`. Then call `render_research_report` with the absolute workspace path. The renderer parses Markdown into tokens and renders paragraphs, citations, primary quotations, tables, and visual specifications through controlled React components. Never write page HTML, raw SVG, CSS, or scripts in `report.md`. The output is self-contained, contains no browser React runtime, and is ready for upload.
10. Inspect the compiled report at desktop and narrow-phone widths, rerun `render_research_report` after any Markdown or visual change, then call `validate_research_workspace`. Repair every error before delivery. Successful validation also closes the research run.

Keep all staged files traceable to `evidence.json`. Do not skip from search notes or module memos directly to the final report.

The bundled `research_search` and `research_get_chunk` tools are the research corpus interface. Do not infer that the corpus is unavailable merely because no separate “knowledge base” skill is installed. If search returns no results or the research proxy is unavailable, report that exact retrieval status and stop evidence-based conclusions; do not replace the research with unsupported industry generalizations.

## Evidence Layers

`sell` contains research published by sell-side institutions. It represents what the market believes: earnings forecasts, key assumptions, debates, risks, and valuation frameworks. Use it to extract the investment logic, causal chain, key assumptions, forecasts, disagreements, and valuation framework, and to understand what the market has priced in. Treat its conclusions as hypotheses to test against industry-expert and official material, not proof of industry reality.

`sell` is also the primary source of structured quantitative material—market size, shipments, pricing, capex, shares, costs, forecasts, model tables, and historical series—and it should be used extensively to build the report's tables, charts, forecasts, valuation ranges, and model calculations. Calibrate key figures against `primary` where available, but using `sell` quantitative content is expected and correct, not a defect; only its uncalibrated conclusions are treated as hypotheses rather than proven fact.

Within `primary`, search two material categories separately:

- **Industry-expert material:** expert interviews, former-employee interviews, industry-participant or consultant conversations, channel checks, fieldwork, and research notes based on direct industry-participant commentary. Search across customers and end users, procurement or operations staff, upstream suppliers, competitors, distributors and channel partners, integrators, and former executives or employees. Use these materials to identify leading changes in demand, orders, inventory, capacity, pricing, delivery, product progress, and market share. Seek supporting, opposing, and conflicting views from different roles and value-chain positions.
- **Official material:** regulatory filings, company announcements, government documents, investor-relations materials, and earnings releases or calls. Use these materials to confirm disclosed facts and management statements. Earnings-call management commentary is official material, not an expert interview.

Finding official materials does not complete primary research. Continue searching industry-expert material until the core industry claims have broad, independent expert coverage or the remaining evidence gap is explicitly reported.

`primary` outweighs `sell`. Sell-side views are hypotheses to be tested against primary reality, not co-equal proof: when the two conflict on the same question, let `primary` control the conclusion and keep the overruled sell-side view visible as a disagreement. A claim supported only by sell-side narrative carries less evidence strength than one calibrated by primary material, and should be labeled accordingly.

For every material claim, record support, opposing evidence, calibration result, unresolved point, evidence strength, and what would change the judgment. If no primary calibration exists, state that plainly.

## Long Report

The expert-evidence gate is a quality bar on the evidence, not a scope limit on the report. Passing it does not mean the report is finished: the final report must still present the complete argumentation for every accepted module, covering each accepted module's full reasoning from evidence to conclusion. Satisfying the visible-primary requirements never licenses dropping analysis, chapters, or accepted modules to make validation easier.

`final_report.md` is an editorial synthesis of complete chapter drafts, not a one-shot answer, an unedited concatenation, or a dump of module memos.

- Let the topic and available evidence determine the final length. Do not set word, character, chapter, argument, or source-count targets. Judge completeness by whether the report contains every decision-relevant layer supported by the evidence.
- Argue completely. Every material conclusion must show its full inference chain — data → mechanism → intermediate inference → conclusion — with each link stated explicitly and either evidence-backed or flagged as an assumption. Do not skip intermediate reasoning steps; if a link cannot be supported, say so instead of writing around it. When brevity and a complete argument conflict, keep the complete argument.
- Before finalizing a deep comparative or ranked report, reopen the outline and module memos and check for missing mechanism, normalization, scenarios, alternatives, valuation, monitoring, or unresolved conflicts. Give each material alternative enough separate treatment to make the ranking auditable; do not hide distinct investment questions inside one compressed paragraph.
- Each substantive section should connect its conclusion to source-backed data, causal transmission, comparison or calculation where relevant, primary calibration, boundary/opposing evidence, and research implication. The winning thesis needs a complete demand → qualified supply → pricing → margin/EPS → valuation bridge.
- Preserve useful detail from chapter drafts: decisive numbers, formula or normalization basis, scenario assumptions, stock-specific catalysts, disconfirming evidence, and ranking-flip conditions. Summarize source descriptions, not the reasoning needed to audit the investment decision.
- Use extracted sell-side data, primary calibration, disagreements, scenarios, sensitivities, and company-level transmission where they help answer the topic. Do not add generic filler or repeat the same number.
- Rewrite and de-duplicate chapter material when it improves flow, including semantically repeated background with different wording. Before delivery, compare `final_report.md` against every chapter and `decision.md`; preserve each distinct mechanism, decisive number or calculation, citation, disagreement, boundary, unresolved point, invalidating condition, and the ranking recorded in `decision.md`. Resolve draft contradictions instead of concatenating them.

## Final Report and HTML

Use sell-side material for the analytical frame and structured data; use primary material for validation, narrative proof, and calibration. Sell-side data may be used extensively in tables, charts, forecasts, valuation ranges, and model calculations, but key figures should be calibrated by primary evidence where available. Expert evidence is the report's highest-priority reader-facing evidence layer. The report body must show complete passages from multiple independent expert sources and cover the core industry claims; a single quote, sentence excerpt, or source-only listing is invalid. For every core industry claim supported or challenged by expert evidence, show at least one matched expert passage in a visible `primary-quote` block.

Write primary evidence quotations as ordinary Markdown blockquotes, followed inside the same blockquote by `来源：<exact source party/title> · <publication date>`. The React renderer turns them into visible `.primary-quote` components. Keep page/line locators inside `evidence.json` for traceability, not in the reader-facing source line. Never write a generic label or invent a source. Write exact sell-side citations in Markdown; the renderer maps them to evidence and creates `.src` hover tooltips.

Match every reader-facing quotation to the report language. For a Chinese-language report, translate every non-Chinese sell-side tooltip and primary quotation into complete, faithful Chinese before rendering it; do not expose a long English passage merely because the source is English. Preserve every sentence, number, date, qualifier, and paragraph boundary, and do not summarize, abridge, or insert ellipses. Store the source passage verbatim in `evidence.json.quote` for auditability and store the full Chinese display translation in `evidence.json.quote_zh`; render `quote_zh` in `.tip-bd`, `.primary-quote`, and the workbench evidence ledger. When the source passage is already Chinese, render `quote` directly and omit `quote_zh`. Keep tooltip body text plain without `<u>` or underlines. Source titles, institution names, and citation locators may remain in their returned form. Every claim, quote, table source, chart source, and tooltip must map to `evidence.json`. Keep disagreements visible.

Place each visible `primary-quote` immediately after the paragraph, list item, or table interpretation that states the claim it supports, challenges, or calibrates. Introduce the quotation in the surrounding prose and explain its investment meaning before moving to the next claim. Multiple independent quotations may appear together when they add distinct evidence to the same immediately preceding claim. Do not relocate decision-relevant quotations away from their argument merely to collect them elsewhere in the report. Use only accepted evidence mapped in `evidence.json`; do not invent or add evidence to satisfy layout or coverage rules.

The bundled React static renderer reads `assets/template.html` as the visual source of truth and owns the page shell, Markdown token rendering, section wrappers, evidence-linked citation tooltips, responsive rules, controlled visual components, and static-document assembly. Models write `report.md` plus `visuals.json`; they must not insert raw page HTML, SVG, CSS, JavaScript, a card layout, or a different structure. Preserve the template's header, judgment block, section layout, source bar, hover-tooltip system, and visual language. Record `report_month` or the data cutoff in `coverage_stats.json` so the renderer can display it.

Keep `report.html` reader-facing and single-page, exactly following the bundled template's structure and visual language. Do not add report/evidence tabs or embed the audit ledger into the page. The audit trail remains in `sell_side_logic.md`, `validation.md`, `evidence_disposition.md`, `decision.md`, and `evidence.json`. Do not leave template placeholders unresolved.

Long HTML should feel like an editorial report, not a tall text dump. Keep the full prose, but break it with natural section labels, compact evidence tables, visible primary quotations, and only the figures that materially advance the decision. On desktop and narrow-phone screenshots, inspect the beginning, middle, and end of the page; verify that wide tables remain readable, no section is clipped, and the renderer has not silently dropped late-report content.

For visual selection, financial chart grammar, annotation, uncertainty, responsive composition, and screenshot-based review, use the separate `investment-visualization` skill. Keep that editorial judgment in the skill rather than encoding it as validator regex or fixed HTML classes.
