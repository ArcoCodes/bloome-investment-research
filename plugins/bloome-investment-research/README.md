# Bloome Investment Research Plugin

Cross-runtime, evidence-first investment research for Codex and Claude Code.

- Codex or Claude Code is the reasoning runtime; no separate model key is required.
- The first corpus call opens Bloome Finance in the browser for Google or email sign-in and local-device authorization. No copied API token is required.
- Each new research workspace uses one account credit on its first data request, or no credit during active annual unlimited access; successful workspace validation closes that run.
- The shared MCP server provides the same research and validation tools in both hosts.
- Codex renders the native PiP/fullscreen workbench. Claude Code returns progress, evidence, artifacts, and `reportPath` without injecting the complete HTML report into model context.
- Bloome styling applies to the optional workbench only.
- `skills/investment-research/assets/template.html` remains the final report's single-page visual source of truth. Evidence disposition, decision logic, and the evidence ledger remain separate Markdown/JSON workspace artifacts.
- `skills/investment-visualization/` owns editorial chart selection, annotation, uncertainty, responsive composition, and screenshot-based visual review; those judgments are not encoded as validator regex.

Runtime manifests are generated from `plugin.config.json`; do not edit `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, or either marketplace by hand.
